# Task 201: Numerical analysis - 2nd task


`Guideline:`

```
- Don't copy each-others code.
- Follow proper naming convension.
```

`Submission procedure:`
```
- Use same github repo(in which you submitted Task 101) to submit the tasks.
- There is no specific programming language restriction.
- The file name should contain string 'Gaussian_Elimination' (i.e. Gaussian_Elimination.cpp)
```

## 05_Gaussian_Elimination
Complete the following tasks with Naive Gauss Elimination:

The upward velocity of a rocket is given at three different times in Table 1.

Table 1: Velocity vs. time data.

| Time, t (s)    | Velocity, v (m/s) |
| -------- | ------- |
| 5  | 106.8    |
| 8 | 177.2     |
| 12    | 279.2    |

**The velocity data is approximated by a polynomial as:** 

$ v(t) = a_1t^2 + a_2t + a_3, \ \ 5 <= t <= 12 $


### Questions
**_Q1:_** Find the values of $a_1$, $a_1$ and $a_1$ using the NaÃ¯ve Gauss elimination method. 

**_Q2:_** Find the velocity at $t = 6$ seconds.
