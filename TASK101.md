# Task 101: Numerical analysis - 1st task

These tasks are to assess students' theoretical learning of numerical-methods using GNU Octave.

`Guideline:`

```
- Don't copy each-others code.
- Follow proper naming convension.
- Submit each task in a separate file.
```

`Submission procedure:`
```
- Each task should have a different file (e.g. Task_101.m)
- Use github to submit the tasks.
```

## Task_101
Complete the following tasks of matrix manipulation:

- Define two matrices A & B. The values of these matrix will be taken as input from command-line
- Print the max value from matrix A
- Multiply matrix A & B. Handle the case where multiplication can not be possible(print proper message/resulten matrix).

## Task_102

Implement root finding **Bisection** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.

## Task_103
Implement root finding **False-position** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.

## Task_104
Implement root finding **Newton-raphson** method.

- Store root of each iteration in a matrix.
- Plot the equation with the matrix of root so that the graphical view of finding roots can be achieved.
- `Bonus(+5)`: Draw the tangent/slope line you found at each iteration.
